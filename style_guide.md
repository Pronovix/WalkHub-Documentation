# Style guide

In contrast with most other stepped contextual help solutions, by default steps in Walkthroughs donâ€™t have a title. The text field for content entry is kept small on purpose to encourage writers to add instructions only relevant to a specific step.

* Writers should give each step a description that is a maximum of two short sentences (and ideally just one).
* Each step should only address one concept or the one thing that the user can do at that point.
* A step must only reference the exact item it's pointing to (no mention of other items on the page, other pages, and so on).
* Technical terms and jargon should be avoided unless it is fundamental to understanding the step.   
* A step should not contain anything that doesn't help the reader understand the object that the step is pointing to (no titles for instance).
